# Eyes

# These eyes follow your mouse.

Description: This page has pair of eyes that follows your mouse movement. It uses javascript and CSS. Move your mouse pointer to see the eyes follow the pointer. Click "Silly Eyes" button to see the eyes act silly while follwoing the pointer. Click the "Creepy Eyes" button to view the creepier version of this app.

Roadmap of future improvements: I plan to add logic to make this into a widget that can installed on a computer to modify the mouse pointer to have a trailing pair of these eyes!.
